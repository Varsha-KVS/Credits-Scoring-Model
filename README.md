# 📝 Credit Scoring Model

## 📌 Introduction  
This project aims to develop a *Credit Scoring Model* using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the *creditworthiness* of individuals based on their financial features. The model is built using *scikit-learn* and focuses on achieving high accuracy in predicting whether a person is likely to default on a loan.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals, such as their *income, **loan amount, and **credit history*. It is a standard dataset used in financial machine learning applications and is available from various sources like Kaggle.

## 🔧 Installation  
To run this project, install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

🚀 How to Run

1. Open Jupyter Notebook.


2. Run all cells in the .ipynb file.


3. The model will train on the dataset and display the results, including accuracy and evaluation metrics.



📊 Results

Model Accuracy: 84.3

The model uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines for predicting creditworthiness.

Evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model.


🔥 Future Improvements

Incorporate more financial features to improve the model’s prediction.

Experiment with ensemble methods or deep learning techniques for better accuracy.

Use real-world data for a more accurate model.
